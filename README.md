# Robot-project-2nd-year-univ
Arduino part for control a robot . Here we use Arduino Romeo V 2.2

During our 1st semester of 2nd year of university , we develop a controler on andrid to drive the robot , then we add an automaticly mod which use
sensors like infrared and ultrasonic , and it can moove in free area without hit an object.

In my part here I develop the code for Arduino, I receive the bluetooth frame for motors and servomotor , and I send the frame witch sensors values.

So enjoy and do not hesitate to comment my code if I can improve it or change something.
