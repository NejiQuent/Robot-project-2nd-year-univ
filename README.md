# Robot remote controlled
Hello everyone, I propose you my code which I develop during my project, here we use Arduino Romeo V 2.2 its same microprocessor than a Arduino Leonardo.

During our 1st semester of 2nd year of university , my teammates develop a controller on Android to drive the robot , then we add an automatically mod which use sensors like infrared and ultrasonic. Our robot can moove in free area without hit an object.

In my part here I develop the code for Arduino. I need to collect sensors values and read/write on the bluetooth. I receive the bluetooth frame for motors and servomotor, and I send the frame with sensors values.

We add a servor motor with a support for light which we can controle with seek bar on Android.

Finally my mate include a database internal of android, we use it to record values , and we have a button comeback , if we press it , the robot go backward and follow it's last position.

You can find my code (only arduino) and a doc what we make to understand the robot cabling and on which pins we set our sensors/motors.

So enjoy and do not hesitate to comment my code if I can improve it or change something. I just want to learn and be better in C++.
