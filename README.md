# Robot-project-2nd-year-univ
Hello everyone, I propose you my code which I develop during my project, here we use Arduino Romeo V 2.2 its same microprocessor than a Arduino Leonardo.

During our 1st semester of 2nd year of university , we develop a controler on andrid to drive the robot , then we add an automaticly mod which use
sensors like infrared and ultrasonic , and it can moove in free area without hit an object.

In my part here I develop the code for Arduino, I receive the bluetooth frame for motors and servomotor , and I send the frame witch sensors values.

You can find my code and a doc what we make to understand the robot cabling and on which pins we set our sensors/motors.

So enjoy and do not hesitate to comment my code if I can improve it or change something. I just want to learn and be better in C++.
